## Security Analysis

### üö® Risk Factors

1. **HIGH RISK - Unverified Contract**

   - Unverified contracts can hide malicious functions

2. **MEDIUM RISK - Active Owner**
   - Contract ownership has NOT been renounced
   - Owner address: `0xC5D133296E17BA25DF0409a6C31607bf3B78e3e3`
   - Owner can potentially modify contract behavior

3. **Token Age**

   - Relatively new token in the ecosystem

  - Initial mint: 4,000,000,000 SDM
  - One transfer of 100 SDM on September 9, 2025
- **Holder Data**: Not yet available on Arbiscan
- **Liquidity**: No confirmed liquidity pools found on major DEXs

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Request Contract Verification** - Contact the team to verify the contract on Arbiscan
2. **Check Liquidity** - Verify liquidity pools before any trading
3. **Research Project** - Find official website, whitepaper, and documentation
